Born in the image of our ancestors, Radiant peoples have long struggled with the legacy of their heritage. How do you tell the story of your past when time has made half of it illegible? Can you take pride in the history of your culture when it was so fueled by exploitation and violence? And if you cut away the flaws of your ancestors, how do you know that there will be anything left to guide you today? These questions have long hung over the people of Tamaris, and Radiant humanity feels them keenly."},"folder":"Jz1yD35kaDA2NZtZ","sort":100000,"flags":{}}

Not everyone hid in the bunkers as the world came down around them. When the cataclysm washed over the world and the transcendent forces followed, some people found themselves changed by the fallout—and others changed themselves to survive it. Some Adapted peoples have feline ears and a tail on top of an otherwise-conventional frame; others have black sclera, gills, and nictating third eyelids; still others are insectoid from head to toe, with chitin and fully-functional antennae. More dramatic adaptations tend to be passed down along family lines—a full-body set of scales is the kind of thing you typically inherit from your parents—but even today, there are still people adapting themselves for their environments, pushing the boundaries of who we are and who we can be."},"folder":"Jz1yD35kaDA2NZtZ","sort":500000,"flags":{}}

Most synths approximate a human body shape, since the first of them were made to resemble their Radiant creators, but as time goes on, many young synths are often keen to try out new shapes and platforms"},"folder":"Jz1yD35kaDA2NZtZ","sort":400000,"flags":{}}

{"_id":"TiL4AssY9Ryty6f9","name":"Imperial","permission":{"default":0},"type":"heritage","system":{"description":"If you want to be from the most oppressive regime in Tamaris, you could be from the Red Empire. Officially, this country is called Corundum, but it’s rare that anybody outside it uses that name. If you are from here, you’re probably a refugee. The Empire typically considers emigration an act of treason, and tries to establish tight control of its borders—but the further away you get from the core, the easier it is to sneak by Imperial patrols. All of the major nations provide legal protection for Imperial refugees, and the Empire generally doesn’t try to test that commitment. The smaller governments of the Meridian Valley, however, are often much less able to put up a fight. If you have any Imperial refugees in your crew, you start with +2 pressure."},"sort":300000,"flags":{}}
